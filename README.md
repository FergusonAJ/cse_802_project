# Leaf-based plant classification
## CSE 802 Final Project

A classifier system to assign plant leaves to their species based on processed images. 

All R scripts are located in the root directory. 
pca*, mda*, and standard*.R were the files used to generate the data, with the helper of all the helper* files. combine_plots.R was used to aggregate data into the final plots in the paper.

All plots are in subdirectories of the ./plots/ directory, numerical confusion matrices are in the ./confusion_matrices/ directory, and all of the other raw output data is in the ./output_data/ directory. 

Cheers!
